        <p>How can the public’s trust in the news survive in a world of mass media consumption, the internet and recent funding losses for the news media?</p>

        <p>“Social media is rising in power, and there’s also a rise of citizen journalists on YouTube and social media,” said DaNeen L. Brown, a professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism.</p>

        <p>Brown, who has worked at <i>The Washington Post</i> for the last 35 years, said that she is “disappointed in the [journalism] industry.”<p/>

        <p>“The journalism model that I came into as a young reporter is no longer there,” she said. “We’re living in a time when all of those principles of journalism are being tossed on their head,” which she recalls as truth reporting.</p>

        <p>Legacy mainstream media outlets such as <i>The Washington Post</i> compete with modern forms of media. However, it comes at a cost for both media outlets and the media consumers.</p>

        <p>Not only are “the algorithms feeding readers particular news,” but “people have a hard time distinguishing the truth from what is not true,” she said.</p>
        <p> According to Brown, media outlets are not entirely to fault, and people are also “not learning to be independent critical thinkers.”</p>
        <p>How do you improve credibility among readers?</p>

        <p>“Maybe you can’t,” she said.</p>

        <p>When asked to describe what the current state of news media feels like, Injoo Lee, a junior psychology and economics major, said she felt “disheartened.”</p>

     <p>“[news organizations] just keep putting out information that will keep those people loyal and coming back to them,” even if that news isn’t objective, she said.</p>

<p>“It's just kind of upsetting that now we can't just have news.” “People want quick things all the time now, myself included … everyone just wants convenience,” she said.</p>

        <p><strong>Why do you choose to consume news on these platforms? What makes you inclined to these platforms in particular?</strong></p>
        <p>Student’s consensus for choosing to consume news on their desired platform was for the ease of use and convenience, according to the responses collected. Social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram were among the most popular news sources for students.</p>

        <p>Nearly 69 percent of respondents said they primarily use social media to consume news.</p>

<p>Aadriana Hicks, a freshman architecture major, agreed that news can easily be found through social media, but still “not enough people are aware of what’s going on,” she said.</p>

<p>All survey respondents agreed that it is important to stay informed on current events. 38 percent of survey respondents said they were “somewhat” well informed on current events. </p>

<p><strong>In your opinion, how can media outlets improve public trust?</strong></p>

<p>Hicks said that misinformation is becoming a larger issue and that news outlets should focus more on “getting the story out there, and less of getting an opinion out there.”</p>

<p>College students are becoming more egotistical in their views. Hicks also acknowledged the need for students to have the responsibility to research all perspectives and not just rely on those that confirm their own beliefs.</p>

<p>Izzy Deprez, a senior psychology major, said that the public’s trust in news outlets is not possible, regardless of how unbiased the news is.</p>

<p>“If the person reading doesn’t agree, it’ll be biased according to them,” she said. “A lot of people our age now are getting their information from people online,” she said.</p> 

<p>Deprez suggested that a solution to help combat the issues of media bias and misinformation is to require students to take a media literacy class in college.</p>
