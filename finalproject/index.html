     <h3>Can public trust in journalism survive in an era of mass media consumption, internet dominance and widespread funding cuts?</h3>

      <p>As the media landscape rapidly evolves, questions arise about whether the news readers consume today remains credible, fact-based and informative.</p>

      <p>DaNeen L. Brown, a professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, has worked at <i>The Washington Post</i> for 35 years. She reflected on the journalism industry’s transformations and expressed disappointment in its current direction.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
  “The journalism model that I came into as a young reporter is no longer there,” she said. “We’re living in a time when all of those principles of journalism are being tossed on their head.”
</blockquote>

      <p>Legacy and mainstream outlets such as The Post, which once relied on print circulation, now face financial struggles and competition from the rise of social media and mass media consumption. The changes impact the credibility of news outlets and the trust of its readers, she said.</p>

      <p>Brown also emphasized the responsibility of the readers to take ownership in news literacy. However, restoring credibility may no longer be possible because of “an ignorance in the masses,” and a “decline in the way people are consuming news.”</p>

      <p>Not only are “the algorithms feeding readers particular news,” but “people have a hard time distinguishing the truth from what is not true,” she said.</p>

      <p>Brown suggested that news organizations can rebuild trust by reverting back to an independent business model, detached from corporate ownership and influence.</p>

      <p>“Journalism as an institution used to be independent, and many reporters prided themselves in not being afraid of holding the powerful accountable,” Brown said, referring to The Post’s Watergate-era coverage.</p>

    <h3>Student Input</h3>

    <p>A survey on news consumption and related beliefs was conducted in April 2025, with 32 undergraduate students from the University of Maryland participating. The following questions and data are directly from that survey:</p>

      <p><strong>Why do you choose to consume news on these platforms? What makes you inclined to these platforms in particular?</strong></p>

      <p>Students cited ease of use and convenience as their main reasons for choosing particular platforms. TikTok and Instagram were the most frequently mentioned sources.</p>

      <p>Nearly 65 percent of respondents said they primarily use social media to consume news.</p>

      <p>Aadriana Hicks, a freshman architecture major, agreed that news can easily be found through social media, but still “not enough people are aware of what’s going on,” she said.</p>

      <p>All survey respondents agreed that it is important to stay informed on current events. 31 percent of survey respondents said they were “somewhat” well informed on current events. </p>

      <p><strong>In your opinion, how can media outlets improve public trust?</strong></p>

      <p>Hicks said that misinformation is becoming a larger issue and that news outlets should focus more on “getting the story out there, and less of getting an opinion out there.”</p>

      <p>When asked to describe what the current state of news media feels like, Injoo Lee, a junior psychology and economics major, said she felt “disheartened.”</p>

      <p>“[News organizations] just keep putting out information that will keep those people loyal and coming back to them,” even if that news isn’t objective, she said.</p>

      <p>Lee added that, “people want quick things all the time now, myself included … everyone just wants convenience."</p>

      <p>College students are becoming more egotistical in their views. Hicks also acknowledged the need for students to have the responsibility to research all perspectives and not just rely on those that confirm their own beliefs.</p>

      <p>Izzy Deprez, a senior psychology major, said that regaining public trust in news outlets is unlikely, even when the reporting is unbiased.</p>

      <p>“If the person reading doesn’t agree, it’ll be biased according to them,” she said. “A lot of people our age now are getting their information from people online.”</p> 

      <p>Deprez suggested that a solution to help combat the issues of media bias and misinformation is to require students to take a media literacy class in college.</p>
